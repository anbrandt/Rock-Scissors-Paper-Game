Classic Rock Scissors Paper Game. I wrote it in four packages:
- RSP_basic is just the main class and all the logic are in the same class
- RSP_MVC written using Model View Controller design pattern, although im not sure about the delegation of responsibilites between
View and Controller
- RSP_OOP - classic Object Oriented Programming approach. Using Single Responsibility Principle i built six classes and one interface. While trying to keep responsibilities separate i also keep the game open for extensions (fe. add another figure for the game or another player)
- RSP_Sockets - two classes: one for Client Socket, second for Server Socket. Not done yet
